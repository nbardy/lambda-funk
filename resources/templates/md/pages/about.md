I'm Nicholas Bardy. I started programming around 2006 when I recieved my first personal comptuer, the glorious TI-89) Programming is my what I do for work, sometimes fun, and hopefully to have a positive effect on the world. After five years of filling the dregs of my Dropbox with endless drafts of blog posts. I decided its time to start finishing some. 

The focus of programming is often about the results. This is my opportunity to spend time thinking about the why and how. Sharing my writing in the hope that it can evoke some reaction in the people who read it. If you have a respond to share, good or bad, I would love to here from you.
